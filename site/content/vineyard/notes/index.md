Iron spikes inserted in vines showing most chlorosis. I will see how these do and I may install them for every vine.

The drought is very bad right now. Everything is dead around here.
I noticed some deer damage. By the time I could get an eleteic fence up they had stripped almost every bit of green from the vines. They are relentless. I put in a 3 wire electric fence 4 feet high with a second fence 4 feet inside that one with a 60 mile charger. After several hilarious touches of that fence the deer seem discouraged now. I think the vines will all recover.

Sprayed all vines with chelated iron. Lots of vines showing symptoms of chlorosis. I appreciate the help from Penny at VineCo Tx who helped me determine what the issue it. Our soil is limestone and is around 8 PH. This means minerals like iron are chemically bound up with the calcium and it can be hard for plants to get what they need.
