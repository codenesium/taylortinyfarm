Applied 1 cup of ferrilene diluted into 5 gallons of water using my new venturi fertilizer injector(https://www.dripdepot.com/item/drip-depot-economy-venturi-injector-inlet-outlet-size-half-inch-mpt?gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwge2iBhBBEiwAfXDBR4aJus7yuivPgjM5TuPE7fZXiqyzRTX7LeGTF-lzbnqKwH_UczD8TxoCcIgQAvD_BwE).

It works better than I expected. I estimate it took an hour to apply all of it.

The weather has been amazing. We're still in a drought but we have been getting a regular 1/2 inch of rain. The grass is green. I'm still irrigating but getting to skip some runs.

#### 05/03/2023
Realized I need to raise or lower all of my catch wires or the vines will attach to them which is not what you want. Raised them all up to the top for now. Also realized I need to drive all of the trellis wire support posts about 8-12 inches deeper so the first set up catch wires is 10 inches or so above the cordon wire. Currently it's 14-18 above which is wrong. I just need to drive them deeper. I'm having trouble with my irrigation drippers continuing to drip. They are pressure compensating but I think they are wearing out a bit. I bought some more expensive replacement drippers that require 15psi or to to drip. They're expensive at 40 cents a piece. I think I can just replace the ones that drip incorreclty piecemeal but if I could do it over I'd install these fancy drippers from the beginning.

Wow it's been busy. Training vines requires a lot more attention than I expected. I'm in the vineyard almost every day training vines and knocking off laterals. I'm not sure how you would keep up on acres of vines unless you did it 60 hours a week. We had around 15 vines that didn't come back so I ordered 1103P rootstock vines and replaced all of those. I realized the rootstock on all of the Montepulciano vines is not what I wanted. I wanted 1103P everywhere because it handles limestone and drought well. What I bought was 10/5BB and 10/101-14. Expensive mistake and the worst to make. These are not good for my area. They're sensitive to chlorosis and drought and that makes sense because last year the worst chlorosis problems I had were in the Montepulciano. I will likely have to replant the Montepulicano. I think I can replace them over time planting the rootstock and doing grafts. It will be a good learning experience.

We have bud burst and we have lots of growth. Applied 1 teaspoon of Ferrilene to all of the vines to get a jump on chlorosis issues.

Vines pruned today. There were a lot that appeared to have no green wood. I'm not sure if they're just still dormant or actually dead. 3 vines had crown gall. 1 vine was entirely rootstock and not the graft. I knew it was something like that as that one vine had very different leaves. I repaired the trellis by digging new holes and using concrete. I don't think there will be any more issues there. If they can support all that ice the grapes won't be an issue. Buds are swelling across the vineyard. Spring appears to be coming early.

Ice Storm! The trellis and vines are all encased in an inch of ice. It's insane. Several of the trellis endposts have been pulled out of the ground.

{{< image src="images/vineyard/2023/february_2023_broken_trellis.jpg" caption="I picked up a section of wire that was 25 feet or so. I'd estimate it weighed at least 25 pounds. These rows are 150 feet or so long and there are 8 wires per trellis. So that comes out to around 1200 pounds. 4 rows had the trellis bent over as they are not that strong in the horizontal direction. It was easy to fix and I don't think any vines were damaged." alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q3" class="img-fluid" webp="true" >}}

#### 01/28/2023
Rows sprayed with glyphosphate. Spring is near but freezing rain is on the way. 

#### 12/20/2022 
Turkey compost spread around all of the vines. Vine shelters removed from all of the vines big enough to stand up. Pruning soon!

#### 12/12/2022 
Vines have been losing their leaves and are going dormant. We've had a lot of consistent rain and the rye grass is doing amazing.

#### 11/01/2022 
I spread rye grass and wildflower seed in the rows. Two passes on the 10 setting. 

#### 10/24/2022 
We had a storm and some of the vines that weren't attached well were broken over. Probably 5 or so. 

#### 10/13/2022 
Started removing vine shelters for winter. My back hurts. 

#### 10/10/2022 
Fertilized all vines with about 1/2 shovel of turkey compost. 

#### 9/14/2022 
Applied chelated iron spray to vines showing most chlorosis. Applied 64 oz or so  of chelated iron through irrigation. 

#### 9/11/2022
Iron spikes inserted in vines showing most chlorosis. I will see how these do and I may install them for every vine. They're made for palm trees and are a bit expensive but I think they will help. I also installed them around all of my new trees that are showing chlorosis symptoms.

We've had quite a bit of rain in the last month. We went 3 weeks with no irrigation which is great. Rain helps to remove salts and anything else that's been accumulating in the soil. The vines really liked the rainwater.

#### 9/9/2022
Sprayed all vines with chelated iron. Montepulciano showing the most chlorosis. Vines are recovered from the attack of the deer.

#### 9/1/2022
Sprayed all vines with chelated iron.

#### 8/31/2022
Sprayed all vines with chelated iron. 

#### 8/1/2022
The drought is very bad right now. I'm irrigating about 15 gallons per vine per week which is a lot of water. Everything is dead around here.
I noticed some deer damage. By the time I could get an eletric fence up they had stripped almost every bit of green from the vines. They are relentless. I put in a 3 wire electric fence 4 feet high with a second fence 4 feet inside that one with a 60 mile charger. After several hilarious touches of that fence the deer seem discouraged now. I think the vines will all recover.

#### 7/15/2022
Sprayed all vines with chelated iron. Lots of vines showing symptoms of chlorosis. I appreciate the help from Penny at VineCo Tx who helped me determine what the issue it. Our soil is limestone and is around 8 PH. This means minerals like iron are chemically bound up with the calcium and it can be hard for plants to get what they need.
