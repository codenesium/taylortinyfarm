Fertilized all vines with about 1/2 shovel of turkey compost. 

#### 9/14/2022 
Applied chelated iron spray to vines showing most chlorosis. Applied 64 oz or so  of chelated iron through irrigation. 

#### 9/11/2022
Iron spikes inserted in vines showing most chlorosis. I will see how these do and I may install them for every vine. They're made for palm trees and are a bit expensive but I think they will help. I also installed them around all of my new trees that are showing chlorosis symptoms.

We've had quite a bit of rain in the last month. We went 3 weeks with no irrigation which is great. Rain helps to remove salts and anything else that's been accumulating in the soil. The vines really liked the rainwater.

The drought is very bad right now. I'm irrigating about 15 gallons per vine per week which is a lot of water. Everything is dead around here.
I noticed some deer damage. By the time I could get an eletric fence up they had stripped almost every bit of green from the vines. They are relentless. I put in a 3 wire electric fence 4 feet high with a second fence 4 feet inside that one with a 60 mile charger. After several hilarious touches of that fence the deer seem discouraged now. I think the vines will all recover.

Sprayed all vines with chelated iron. Lots of vines showing symptoms of chlorosis. I appreciate the help from Penny at VineCo Tx who helped me determine what the issue it. Our soil is limestone and is around 8 PH. This means minerals like iron are chemically bound up with the calcium and it can be hard for plants to get what they need.
