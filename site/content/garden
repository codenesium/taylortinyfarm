Crop Details

> Each crop entry includes start method, sow/transplant timing, depth, spacing, pH, water, height, production window, soil impact, and special notes.

---

Tomatoes (Plum Regal, Juliet, Viva Italia, Sungold, Cherry 100)
- Start method: Indoors 6–8 weeks before transplant.  
- Sow: late Jan → mid‑Feb for mid‑March transplant.  
- Transplant: mid‑March → early April after hardening.  
- Depth: bury to first true leaves (deep planting).  
- Spacing: 24–30 in.  
- pH: 6.0–6.8.  
- Water: Consistent moisture; drip irrigation at root zone; avoid wet foliage.  
- Height: 3–6 ft (determinate shorter).  
- Production: June → October (peak midsummer).  
- Soil impact: Heavy feeder; side‑dress with compost; rotate away from potatoes.  
- Special: Use cages or stakes; prune minimally for determinate types.

---

Okra
- Start method: Direct sow after soil ≥65–70°F or start indoors 3–4 weeks earlier.  
- Sow: late April → May (soil warm).  
- Depth: 1 in.  
- Spacing: 18–24 in.  
- pH: 6.0–6.8.  
- Water: Drought tolerant but performs best with regular deep watering.  
- Height: 3–6 ft.  
- Production: Late spring → fall; pick pods young.  
- Soil impact: Moderate feeder; deep roots help soil structure.

---

Italian Bush Green Beans

- pH: 6.0–6.8.  
- Water: Even moisture; avoid waterlogging.  
- Height: 12–24 in.  
- Production: 50–70 days per sowing; multiple flushes.  
- Soil impact: Fixes nitrogen; excellent to follow heavy feeders.

---

Eggplant

Soil, Fertility, and Rotation

- At planting: incorporate 2 in compost into top 6–8 in.  
- Side‑dress: tomatoes and heavy feeders at fruit set and mid‑season.  
- After heavy feeders: add compost and plant legumes or cover crop.  
- pH targets: most crops 6.0–6.8; strawberries 5.5–6.5. Test annually.  
- Rotation: avoid planting tomatoes where potatoes were the previous year.

---

Pest, Disease, and Support Notes

- Tomatoes: cage or stake; scout for hornworms and blight; remove lower leaves.  
- Beans: watch for Mexican bean beetle.  
- Corn: stagger planting to reduce earworm pressure.  
- Watermelon: watch for powdery mildew; avoid overhead watering.  
- General: use row covers early season for flea beetles on eggplant; encourage beneficial insects with flowers.

---

Harvest, Processing, and Storage Notes

- Tomato sauce conversion: 2.5–3 lbs fresh tomatoes ≈ 1 quart finished sauce. With 120–250 lbs tomatoes expect ~40–100 quarts of sauce.  
- Okra: harvest young pods every 2–3 days; freeze blanched or pickle.  
- Strawberries: harvest daily at peak; freeze or preserve.  
- Potatoes: cure and store in cool, dark place.  
- Beans: blanch and freeze or can.

Appendix: Quick Reference — Plant Effects on Soil

- Beans (legumes): fix atmospheric nitrogen via root nodules; improve soil N for following crops.  
- Corn & Potatoes: heavy feeders; remove significant N and other nutrients; follow with compost or legumes.  
- Tomatoes & Eggplant: heavy feeders; benefit from compost and side‑dressing; susceptible to blight if rotated poorly.  
- Carrots & Strawberries: light to moderate feeders; strawberries prefer slightly lower pH.
