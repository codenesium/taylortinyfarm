Running the front end loader on the Kubota without ballast was down right scary as the Kubota is quite tippy without it. I made something to save a few bucks. This uses a drawbar welded to 3 point hitch adaptor. This will work with the Kubota quick hitch and is about  350 pounds of ballast.

{{< image src="images/projects/tractor_ballast/step4.JPG" caption="Final product. This will weigh around 350 pounds which is under the 420 maximum that Kubota recommends. The weight is kepy very low and out back from the tractor which are all great for ballast. Also you can set it down and not tear up anything because of the tire." alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q3" class="img-fluid" webp="true" >}}
